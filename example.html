            chatani Literally translates to water and here the Puris are fried puffed crisp dough balls which are
            hollow.
            Generally,
            the water or pani is sour, tangy as well as spicy. This spicy pani is balanced with the addition of
            sweet
            tamarind
            chutney.
        </p>

        This sweet chutney is called as Meetha (which means sweet) Pani. The spicy water is called as Teekha (which
        means spicy)
        Pani. Both are added in the puri along with the main filling which consists of boiled potatoes, cooked
        chickpeas, moong
        sprouts or a thick dry curry made from white peas which is called as Ragda.

        I don’t know who invented pani puri or how it came into existence. It is one of the popular street foods in
        India.
        Whereas in Mumbai, we call it pani puri. In the northern states, it is called Golgappa and in Bengal, it is
        called as
        Puchka. In Bihar and Jharkand its known as gupchup. So there various ways this street food snack is made and
        enjoyed.

            <h2>How to make Pani Puri</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    . Rinse 1 cup tightly packed coriander leaves, ½ cup tightly packed mint leaves, 2 to 3 green
                    chilies and 1 inch ginger
                    very well in water a few times. Drain all the water.Peel the ginger and roughly chop it. Also chop
                    the green chilies. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and mint leaves.
                    Don’t use the stem of mint leaves as they can make the spiced water have a bitter taste. Only use
                    the fresh mint leaves.
                </li>

                <li>
                    . Add coriander leaves, mint leaves, ginger and green chili in a grinder or blender jar. For a less
                    spicy pani you can
                    add just 1 chopped green chilli.
                </li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon tightly packed tamarind and 3.5 to 4 tablespoons jaggery powder or grated jaggery.

                    If you do not have tamarind, then you can use 2 tablespoons lemon juice. You can also use equal
                    amounts of jaggery and
                    dates. So you can add 2 tablespoons crumbled jaggery and 2 tablespoons chopped dates..</li>
